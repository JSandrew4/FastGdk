FastGdk

The Free And Source Transparent Game Development Kit is a simple to use, open source, cross-platform C++/Lua engine for creating games. It is free for personal and commercial use and is available under the LGPLv3 license. At the moment, the Fast Gdk is still under heavy development and initially will fully support Windows, Gnu/Linux, and Mac OS X. Soon, work will begin on supporting Android, iOS, and BeOS/Haiku as well. The goal for this project is to allow a developer using the engine to focus on simply creating a game and not on low level, OS-specific nonsense, but at the same time to allow the developer the freedom to view and modify the engine source code if needed; the philosophical goal is to promote a development environment that is focused on creativity and community, not on commercial licensing terms, royalties, and working around bugs and oddities in proprietary software that never get fixed.
